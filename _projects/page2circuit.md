description: "page2circuit converts a hand-drawn circuit into digital schematics. It was made using PyTorch and OpenCV. The model was trained using open dataset consisting about 14,000 hand-drawn images of 11 distinct components. The model achieved validation accuracy of 90.35% and training accuracy of 99.9 %. To make it accessible we decided to host using Streamlit, which extremely sharing friendly."
