title: "Khalasi: Energy-Efficient Navigation for Surface Vehicles in Vortical Flow Fields"
description: "Developed RL Models to optimize the ASV's trajectory and control mechanisms to minimize energy expenditure, relying predominantly on thrust-based actuation while simultaneously exploiting naturally occurring environmental phenomena, such as turbulence and vortex structures."
