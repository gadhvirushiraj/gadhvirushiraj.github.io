title: "QuTiP: Enhancing Quantum Circuit Visualization"
description: "QuTiP provides tools for creating and manipulating quantum states and operators, including the QuTiP-QIP module for building circuits with basic and custom gates. However, its circuit visualization depended on LaTeX and ImageMagick, adding extra complexity. This project created two eye-appealing and accurate circuit rendering modules without using external dependency."
