title: "AstroMCMC"
description: "I worked on this project during my internship at Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) with Dr. Arvind Singh Rajpurohit. The project involved analyzing data from the VLT (Very Large Telescope) telescope at ESO (European Southern Observatory). I used a complex statistical method called Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) to initially fine tune a model parameter and later to know which metal elements were abundantly present on the Red Dwarf Star."
